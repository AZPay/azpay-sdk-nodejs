# AZPAY SDK for Node

This SDK is currently in development. Coming soon :)

## How to run the tests (For Developers Only)

You must have a config file on the root called test.config.js:

```javascript
export default {
  merchant_id: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
  merchant_key: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY',
};
```

Run on your terminal:

```bash
yarn test
```

PS: The test.config.js file is ignored on .gitignore
